Re-implementation of the wasserstein gan in Jax
==============================

Presentation
-----------

We needed an implementation of WGAN for another project and wanted to practique with Jax framework. So here is the result.

**Abstract** <br>
We introduce a new algorithm named WGAN, an alternative to traditional GAN training. In this new model, we show that we
can improve the stability of learning, get rid of problems like mode collapse, and provide meaningful learning curves
useful for debugging and hyperparameter searches. Furthermore, we show that the corresponding optimization problem is
sound, and provide extensive theoretical work highlighting the deep connections to other distances between
distributions.
